## Purpose

The primary focus of this project is to create a simple Ye (commonly known as Kanye West) quotes generator. I have always been a Kayne West fan, I remember that back in 2014, He used to post daily quotes on Twitter and he had never failed to make me happy, so hopefully YeQuotes will make your days too.
The app will be an opportunity for myself to use all the knowledge that I have been learning in the past few weeks and put into practice. This include conducting the whole development life-cycle (from planning to deploy it) and use its tools such as: Trello Board, Figma, Escalidraw, also put into practice topics such as: sematic HTML, Flexbox, Grid System and all the fundamental of Javascript including the DOM and of course manipulate the API. 


## MVP:
- To be able fetch any data from the API.
- To be able to fetch  any quote from the API (Console)
- Allow user to get a random quote from the API (DOM)


## Beyond MVP:
- Change background colour everytime a quote is generated.

## Outcomes


- DOM manipulation.
- API fetch and data manipulation.
- Logical thinking and problem solving.
- Planning the whole process.



## Technologies

- CSS ( CSS to styles some of the element to make the website more attractive)
- HTML ( HTML  will be used to give a scheletron of the website)
- Javascript (Create functionalities and get data from API)


## Reflection

Although the nature of the project was simple, I actually learned more than I expected, I believe that all the information and concepts that I digested  in the past weeks, I finally was able to put into practice. This taught me that working on projects is equally if not more important than just learning new concepts as practice makes things perfect. One thing that I can surely seen a big improvement is in design, in the past I used to make low and high prototypes but I always ended up with a totally different design in the end. This time was different, I sticked with my final high fidelity design and was able to replicated using HTML and CSS, this not only helped me to improve my skills in those languages but also saved me so much time. 
I always had fear of using / manipulate the DOM, because I did not fully understand the whole concept, this project had helped me to fight my DOM fears and actually experiment with basic things and solidify my understanding. Adding the fetch API was very useful since I have not fetched the API for a while but thanks to my memory not only I was able to fetch the api and get the data I was interested with, but thanks to a friend of mind I was able to explained him how to properly fetch the data by explaning each bits of the code.
In the end this project seems that encloses everything when it comes to Front-End. It has some  HTML and CSS that gives a GUI and thanks to the DOM Javascript, user can interact with the website.
