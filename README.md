## Purpose

The primary focus of this project is to create a simple Ye (commonly known as Kanye West) quotes generator. I have always been a Kayne West fan, I remember that back in 2014, He used to post daily quotes on Twitter and he had never failed to make me happy, so hopefully YeQuotes will make your days too.
The app will be an opportunity for myself to use all the knowledge that I have been learning in the past few weeks and put into practice. This include conducting the whole development life-cycle (from planning to deploy it) and use its tools such as: Trello Board, Figma, Escalidraw, also put into practice topics such as: sematic HTML, Flexbox, Grid System and all the fundamental of Javascript including the DOM and of course manipulate the API. 


## MVP:
- To be able fetch any data from the API.
- To be able to fetch  any quote from the API (Console)
- Allow user to get a random quote from the API (DOM)


## Beyond MVP:
- Change background colour everytime a quote is generated.
